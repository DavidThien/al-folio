My name is David Thien. I'm currently a 1st year PhD student at UCSD in the [ProgSys](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/) lab. I did my undergrad at UW working in the [PLSE](http://uwplse.org/) lab with [Pavel Panchekha](https://pavpanchekha.com/) and [Zachary Tatlock](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ztatlock/) helping to develop [Herbie](http://herbie.uwplse.org/), as well as tools in [FPBench](http://fpbench.org/).

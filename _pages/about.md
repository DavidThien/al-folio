My name is David Thien.
I'm currently a 2nd year PhD student at UCSD in the [ProgSys](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/) lab advised by [Deian Stefan](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dstefan/).
My work is centered around around applying programming language and systems techniques to solve verification and security problems.
During my undergrad I worked on numerical methods tools with [Pavel Panchekha](https://pavpanchekha.com/) and [Zachary Tatlock](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ztatlock/).

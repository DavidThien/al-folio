My name is David Thien. I'm currently a senior undergrad at the University of Washington. I work in the [PLSE](https://uwplse.org/) lab with my grad advisor [Pavel Panchekha](https://pavpanchekha.com/) supervised by [Zachary Tatlock](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ztatlock/). I mostly work with floating point software and help develop [Herbie](http://herbie.uwplse.org/), as well as tools in [FPBench](http://fpbench.org/). I have also worked with [James Wilcox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jrw12/) on testing the Rust compiler.
